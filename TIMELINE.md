# Project Time Line

Since this project is new there are many features that are missing. To dictate the roadmap of the project implementation will be layed out in this TIMELINE.md file.

If you have ideas for this projects timeline and things we need to work on first you can share your ideas in our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/CodeTopia).

_Since this project uses django python web framework it is verry easy to compartmentalise the code base and collaborate on._

**For early part of this project we will not implement Frontend. But we will be using raw html and some styling just for making it easy to work on the backend and visualizing the backend. If you have a better idea you can open a discussion on telegram by outlining your idea clearly**

## Django apps to be created in order.

### ```accounts``` app.

This django app will handle everything related to the following user activities:

* creating user account.
Fields to create an account are [first_name, last_name, email, username, password], we will be using django's built in User model. If you have a better idea as you can open a discussion by outlining your ideas clearly on our telegram group.

* loging in a registered user.
* loging out logged in user.
* implement changing user password by providing the old password.
* implement password reset.
* create profile model.
  
  Profile model will contain additional field related to the user creating an account.

_If you have a better or adjustment to the above outline feel free to open a discussion on telegram. If you have implemented the above features create pull request and open a discussion on GitHub and Telegram._
